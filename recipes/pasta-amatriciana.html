    <h2>About the Dish</h2>
        <p>Pasta Amatriciana is one of the 4 classic Roman pasta dishes. Before tomatoes were introduced to Italy, chefs relied on animal fats and cheeses to make their sauces. One of those dishes is called Pasta alla Gricia, which is the basis for Pasta Amatriciana. The only difference between the two is Amatriciana was developed after the introduction of tomatoes to Italy. Pasta Amatriciana is essentially a tomato sauce cooked in pork fat (guanciale) seasoned with black pepper and pecorino romano cheese.</p>
        <p>I do not have much personal history with this dish. It is a dish that I found around the same time I found Aglio e Olio, which means that the version I made was by <strong>NOT ANOTHER COOKING SHOW</strong>. I thoroughly enjoyed it, though I had to substitute guanciale with a less expensive/more available option in pancetta. If pancetta is too expensive or hard to come by, smoked streaky bacon will work just fine.</p>
        <p>With all of that being said, let's get cookin'!</p>
