    <h2>About the Dish</h2>
        <p>Aglio e olio is one of the simplest pasta dishes to make. In English, the name of the dish translates to <em>"garlic with olive oil"</em>. Aglio meaning garlic and olio meaning (olive) oil. The dish has its origins in Naples, Italy, and is widely popular. Its popularity can be attributed to its general simplicity, the ready availability of its ingredients, and the ingredients have a generally long shelf-life. Despite its barebones list of ingredients and perceived simplicity, the dish is quite complex to master.</p>
        <p>I found this recipe at a low point in my life when I was dead broke (as if that's changed much). At that time, this dish was a lifesaver that also served as a catalyst for my pasta making journey. While being cheap to make, calorie dense and quite nutritious, it also is a great recipe to learn the fundamentals of cooking a pasta dish. This specific version of the recipe comes from my favourite YouTube chef <strong>NOT ANOTHER COOKING SHOW</strong>. I strongly suggest you, the reader, to check out his website. The website has all of his recipes and each recipe page links to the YouTube video where he makes the recipe.</p>
        <p>Now let's get into the recipe itself.</p>
