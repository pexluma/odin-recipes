    <h2>About the Dish</h2>
        <p>Aglio e olio is one of the simplest pasta dishes to make. In English, the name of the dish translates to <em>"garlic with olive oil"</em>. Aglio meaning garlic and olio meaning (olive) oil. The dish has its origins in Naples, Italy, and is widely popular. Its popularity can be attributed to its general simplicity, the ready availability of its ingredients, and the ingredients have a generally long shelf-life. Despite its barebones list of ingredients and perceived simplicity, the dish is quite complex to master.</p>
        <p>I found this recipe at a low point in my life when I was dead broke (as if that's changed much). At that time, this dish was a lifesaver that also served as a catalyst for my pasta making journey. While being cheap to make, calorie dense and quite nutritious, it also is a great recipe to learn the fundamentals of cooking a pasta dish. This specific version of the recipe comes from my favourite YouTube chef <strong>NOT ANOTHER COOKING SHOW</strong>. I strongly suggest you, the reader, to check out his website. The website has all of his recipes and each recipe page links to the YouTube video where he makes the recipe.</p>
        <p>Now let's get into the recipe itself.</p>

        <h2>List of Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>450 grams of dried Spaghetti Pasta</li>
                <li>3-4 large cloves of garlic (thinly sliced)</li>
                <li>Olive Oil</li>
                <li>1 bunch of Parsley (minced)</li>
                <li>Red Pepper flakes (type/amount to taste)</li>
                <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li> 
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add 2-3 big pinches of salt to a large pot of water set to boil</li>
                <li>Once water is boiling, add the 450g of Spaghetti (we will pull the pasta out 2-3 minutes before the packaging instructs)</li>
                <li>As the water gets close to boiling, add 60ml of olive oil to large skillet pan set to medium/low heat.</li>
                <li>Add the sliced garlic to the olive oil, and after a minute add the pepper flakes.</li>
                <li>Cook the garlic until softened (we don't want it to brown).</li>
                <li>Once the garlic is softened, add a ladle of pasta water to prevent it from cooking futher/cool down the pan a bit.</li>
                <li>Once the pasta is 2-3 from being cooked (according to the package instructions), begin to add pasta to the skillet.</li>
                <li>As the pasta hits the pan begin shaking the pan (horizontal movements only) to move it around.</li>
                <li>As the water evaporates from the pan, continue to add 1 ladle of pasta water at a time until the pasta is cooked to preference (I prefer al-dente).</li>
                <li>While moving the pasta around and cooking it, add in the parsley. This will help the flavours combine.</li>
                <li>The pasta is ready to serve once the noodles are cooked to preference. To maintain sauce integrity continue to add more pasta water.</li>
                <li>Finish it off with a bit more oil right before serving, and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
