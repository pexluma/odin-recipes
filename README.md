# odin-recipes

Hi! My name is Ryan. This has been a long time coming as I have stopped and started TOP multiple times since ~January 2022 with large gaps where no work got done. The current project is to build a website to host recipes on. The skills I will use/demonstrate are as follows:

    1. Ability to manually write an HTML boilerplate 
    2. Ability to use the appropriate tags/elements in their proper places to format the basic outline of the website.
    3. Ability to use Git commands without much/any help from notes (will attempt to do from memory)
    4. Ability to upload the finish project to GitHub and for others to access the site and to have it function as intended.

Self-reflection:
    Initial confusion with the listing element - I used <item> instead of <li> so the first page I made (Aglio e Olio) was a jumbled mess after adding the lists. 

    I needed to look back in my notes on the Git commands - how to add to the staging area, how to commit, etc.
    
    Should have written one universal boilerplate (one with shared aspects) for all three recipe pages to copy/paste and cut down time spent typing it all out. It was a good exercise but inefficient.

    Formatting between the three recipe pages, in terms of writing out steps and measurements of ingredients, were largely similar but I feel more consistency is needed for uniformity. This is due to copying the steps from the source website, which is itself even more inconsistent that I typed out. 

    Overall I enjoyed the experience, though there are time-saving measures I can implement and I need to have a general plan in place to have consistency between pages.
