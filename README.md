# odin-recipes

Hi! My name is Ryan. This has been a long time coming as I have stopped and started TOP multiple times since ~January 2022 with large gaps where no work got done. The current project is to build a website to host recipes on. The skills I will use/demonstrate are as follows:

    1. Ability to manually write an HTML boilerplate 
    2. Ability to use the appropriate tags/elements in their proper places to format the basic outline of the website.
    3. Ability to use Git commands without much/any help from notes (will attempt to do from memory)
    4. Ability to upload the finish project to GitHub and for others to access the site and to have it function as intended.

Self-reflection:
